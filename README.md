# Beverage Sales Dashboard Project - Power BI

## Project Overview

This project is a **Beverage Sales Dashboard** developed using Power BI, aimed at analyzing and visualizing the sales performance of various beverage brands in the United States. The dataset used in this project includes data on beverage sales, operating profits, margins, price per unit, and units sold. Coca-Cola is identified as the leading brand in this dataset.

## Key Features

### 1. Time-based Interactivity
- The dashboard allows users to filter and interact with data over time through a **Time Cursor** feature. This allows for a dynamic view of sales and profits by specific time periods, enabling trend analysis over weeks, months, or years.

### 2. Q&A Functionality
- Using Power BI's **Q&A AI feature**, users can ask questions in natural language to get specific insights from the dataset. For instance, users can type questions like "What is the total sales of Coca-Cola?" or "Which brand has the highest operating profit?" to get instant answers.

### 3. Key Influencers
- The **Key Influencers** visual was added to highlight the drivers of operating profit. It shows which beverage brands contribute the most to increasing operating profit. This feature helps in identifying factors that have a significant impact on profitability.

### 4. Geographical Sales Insights
- A **State Sales Map** visual is included to show geographical "hot spots" of sales across the United States. This map highlights which states are driving the most sales, allowing users to explore regional performance.

### 5. Comprehensive Data Matrix
- A **Matrix** visual displays key metrics for each beverage brand, including:
  - **Total Sales**
  - **Operating Profit**
  - **Profit Margin**
  - **Price per Unit**
  - **Units Sold**

  The matrix is sorted by beverage brands, with Coca-Cola being the top-performing brand in terms of total sales and operating profit.
